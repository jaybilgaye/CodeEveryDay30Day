# Project Development Strategy

##  Implementation Plan

I suggest implementing this system in distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Core Engine (Proof of Concept)
- Implement basic input/output handling.
- Set up the orchestration engine.
- Integrate with one primary LLM for question generation.
- Implement basic solution validation.

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Network
- Integrate multiple LLMs for solution generation.
- Implement the complete agent workflow.
- Develop sophisticated solution comparison logic.

### Phase 3: Refinement and Optimization
- Improve prompt engineering for better questions.
- Optimize token usage and API costs.
- Enhance mathematical rendering and formatting.

### Phase 4: Scaling and Storage
- Implement robust storage for question bank.
- Add batch processing capabilities.
- Develop session management for larger workloads.

##  Token Efficiency Strategies

To address budget concerns:

- **Prompt Compression**: Minimize token usage in prompts
- **Context Windowing**: Only pass relevant information between agents
- **Model Selection**: Use smaller models for non-critical components
- **Caching**: Cache responses to avoid redundant API calls
- **Batching**: Process questions in batches where possible

##  Additional Considerations

### 1 Evaluation Criteria Beyond Answer Matching

- **Pedagogical Value**: Assess educational merit of questions
- **Complexity Analysis**: Ensure appropriate difficulty level
- **Distractibility**: For multiple-choice questions, evaluate quality of distractors
- **Uniqueness Check**: Prevent duplicate or too-similar questions
- **Domain Appropriateness**: Verify question fits target scientific domain

### 2 Mathematical Notation Handling

For proper rendering of scientific notation:

- Use LaTeX formatting for mathematical expressions
- Include ASCII representations as fallback
- Structure output to support future rendering in MathJax/KaTeX
